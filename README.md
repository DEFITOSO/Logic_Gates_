# Logic_Gates_
 This code implements a simple system of neural networks and perceptrons to perform logical operations such as OR, AND, and XOR. Additionally, it includes the capability to train perceptrons to learn these operations through a supervised learning algorithm.

 The code is created to work with arduino. Using a C++ based lenguage and Arduino IDE framework (2.2.1)version.
